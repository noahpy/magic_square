## Using Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization for Magic Square Finding

DPSO is used to search the [7-dimensional space of magic squares](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magisches_Quadrat#Sonstiges).
User can specify an arbritrary magic number, a list of "wish numbers" to be found in the magic square and a cost function.
Furthermore, one can tweak on the hyperparameter of the PSO as well.

Developed for my grandpa.
